# 094295 - Data Science Lab Home Work 2

The assignment is to produce the best accuracy score of ResNet50 predefined model by manipulating a basic set of train and validation data.

In this repo we attached our attempts, code, base dataset and best produced data set.

We attached a "manual cleaning.csv" file indicates which images we deleted and which we set to the correct label.

There are some folders and .tar files:
- "origin data" folder - the origin data set we got
- "origin data.tar" file - the origin data file holding the origin data set.
- "manual clean" folder - the manual cleaned data split to train and val as the origin data set order.
- "data" folder - our augmented data holding train and val folders - each label in the train folder has 800 samples and each label in the val folder has 200 samples,   there for each label has 1000 samlpes and overall 10000 samples.
- "Roman_Numerals_cDCGAN_results" folder - holds the results of the conditional deep convolutional GAN results we tried to train on the origin data.
